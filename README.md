# Sports-Database
As a way of learning more about building and managing a database I decided to make my own using sports using boxing, mixed martial arts, and basketball to start

# Current Sports in the tables
Boxing
MMA

# How I collected the data
I decide to use web scraping as a way to get the data. It made more sense than manually going in and doing data entry for so many fighters. I've uploaded the code and list of links used to get the fighter data.
