# Tech USED:
***Python 3.7***
***SQLite***
***geckodriver (REQUIRED)***

**Note: Boxing and MMA are a little bit trickier to do because wikipedia isn't exactly consistent in the way it formats the tables for the athletes' records. So until I find a work-around to that the data set will be missing them***

# About the Project:
I decided to create a dataset for the sports I follow using different python libraries. Originally I wanted to create a clone of [sports-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/). But I scaled back the project because I lost interest in it and wanted to focus on data collection and web scraping instead.

# What you can find in the repository
You'll be able to see the scripts I wrote to get the stats and where I got the data from. I also included some SQL queries that set up part of the database.

# Recent updates
I finished the BJJ scrape and I'm still cleaning the data for that. I also need to create a spreadsheet to clean the NBA data. With the NBA data done, the NFL data won't be too far away from completion as it's the football equivalent to basketball-reference. The MLB data is one I'm still toying with between ESPN and baseball-reference.

# TODO:
Figuring out how I plan to navigate wikipedia's inconsistent tables.
