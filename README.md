# Tech USED:
***Python 3.7***
***PostgreSQL***
***Docker***

**Note: Boxing and MMA are a little bit trickier to do because wikipedia isn't exactly consistent in the way it formats the tables for the athletes' records. So until I find a work-around to that the data set will be missing them***

# About the Project:
I decided to create a dataset for the sports I follow using different python libraries. Originally I wanted to create a clone of [sports-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/). But I scaled back the project because I lost interest in it and wanted to focus on data collection and web scraping instead.

# What you can find in the repository
You'll be able to see the scripts I wrote to get the stats and where I got them from. I also included some SQL queries that set up part of the database.

# Recent updates
I just got my laptop back so progresss will resume once I switch my OS from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. That'll happen later today.

# TODO:
BJJ / Grappling records from BJJ Heroes
Figuring out how I plan to navigate wikipedia's inconsistent tables.
