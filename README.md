# Tech USED:
***Python 3.7***
***PostgreSQL***
***Docker***

**Note: I would've done Boxing and MMA as a bigger set but the way I planned it was too much for me to do on my own without completely losing my mind going through the data, frying my laptop running the script to get the data, or destorying my CPU trying to put them into excel and my PostgreSQL database.***

# About the Project:
I had decided to recreate the site sports-reference.com as a way to practice full stack development. On sports-reference, the toolbar at the top will link a sport to their respective site (i.e. Basketball to basketball-reference). I wanted to eliminate the redirect and just have every site on one application and domain.

# Recent updates
I'm currently migrating the data from my laptop to a server i've set up at home. I didn't want to use AWS or similar services due to "budget constraints". This should take some time since I have other projects I'm working on at the moment.
