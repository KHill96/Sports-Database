# Tech USED:
***Python 3.7***
***SQLite***
***geckodriver (REQUIRED)***

**Note: Boxing and MMA are a little bit trickier to do because wikipedia isn't exactly consistent in the way it formats the tables for the athletes' records. So until I find a work-around to that the data set will be missing them***

# About the Project:
I decided to create a dataset for the sports I follow using different python libraries. Originally I wanted to create a clone of [sports-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/). But I scaled back the project because I lost interest in it and wanted to focus on data collection and web scraping instead.

# What you can find in the repository
You'll be able to see the scripts I wrote to get the stats and where I got the data from. I also included some SQL queries that set up part of the database.

# Recent updates
I finished the NBA Scrape for the standings so that sport is done. I'm going to start working on the MLB and NFL scripts soon since they come from the same site.

# TODO:
BJJ / Grappling records from BJJ Heroes
Figuring out how I plan to navigate wikipedia's inconsistent tables.
